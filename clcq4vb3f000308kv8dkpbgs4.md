## **What is an open-source project?**

When a project is open-source, that means anybody is free to use, study, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. It also means that you can contribute to it while collaborating with people from across the globe.

**Some popular open-source projects**:- VLC, Chromium, Mozilla Firefox, and Linux.

**What programming languages do you need to contribute to open source?**

Different open-source projects require different programming languages. Some may require Javascript while some may require Python.

**Why contribute to open source?**

It allows us to get real-world software development experience and provides exposure. You can learn while collaborating and communicating with people from all around the world. It also helps in exploring many more exciting technologies and tools. You can also be part of the community-building aspect of the project.

**Are non-code contributions of value?**

Generally, you donâ€™t see as many contributors in the non-code part of the project. What if the community did not have people who write tests, what if there were no people writing bug fixes, and no one to update documentation from time to time, then you might not have as reliable a product as it can be. Without documentation, it might be hard for a beginner to be on board with the project. What use is the project with many features but has a high complexity, unmanaged documentation, and no interaction with the community.
